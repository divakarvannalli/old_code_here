Again, All soil are stones (A) + some stones are hills (I)
= A + I = No conclusion. But the possibility in 2) exists
and the possibility between mountains and stone also
exists. Hence conclusion 4) follows Now, All
mountains are not clouds (O) some mountains are
not clouds (O). So, we can't say no stone is cloud.
Hence 3) may follows. Again, All
soils are stone (A) — conversion some stones are soils
(I). Hence 5) does not follow.
92. Some streams are pounds (I) conversion Some
pounds are streams (I) + All streams are canals (A) =

streams are canals (A) = I + A = I = Some waters are
follows. From statements second conclusion 5) does
not follow.
93. 2; From statements first and second.
Some trees are forest (I)+ Some forests are animals
(I)=I+I = No conclusion. But 1) may follows and
possibility in 3) exists. Hence conclusion 1) and 3)
follow. Again, all herbivores are pets (A) – conversion
– Some pets are herbivores (I). Hence conclusion 2)
does not follow. From statements second possibility
in 5) exist. Hence 5) follows. And possibility in 4) also
follows.
94.1; Some metroes are Smart (I)+ All smart are
electronic vans (A)= I+A=I= Some metroes are
electronic vans (I). Hence conclusion 2) follows. But
from statement four conclusion 2) follows. But from
statement four conclusion 1) does not follow. There is
no negative statements. So possibility in 3) and 4)
exist. Hence conclusion 3) and 4) follow.
Again, conclusion 5) follows from statement first.
95.5; All apples are oranges (A)-conversion – some
oranges are apples (I)+ All apples are not papayas (O)conversion – some apples are not papayas (O)=I+O=
No conclusion.
So, the possibilities in 1) and 3)exist. And conclusion
2) and 4) may follow.
Again, conclusion 5) does not follow from statement
four.

Let x = Anita's age now.
= Difference between their ages NOW is 24-x.
24 - x years ago, Bala was a years old, while Anita was
x-(24-x) = 2x - 24.
During that time, x = 2(2x-24), or x = 4x - 48, or 3x =
48, or x = 16.
Thus Anita is 16 years old now.

112. 21 years. One year from today he will be 22, and
twice as old as he was 10 years ago, i.e. when he was
11.

115. 5 years. The difference in their ages will always
remain the same.

131 (Option D)
Relation between Paarth and Keshav can not be
established with the help of both Statements I and II.
So, both the statements are not sufficient to answer
the question.
132 (Option E)
As given in the Question, M + N + O = 50 yr
N = M + 10
So, Now solve the equation
M + N + O = 50
M + (M + 10) + 30 = 50
2 M + 40 = 50

Page 41

IBPS Clerk Mains : Part - 1
2M = 50 - 40
2M = 10
M = 10/2
M=5
N = M + 10
N = 5 + 10
N = 15
So, both statements are required to answer the
question.
133 (Option E)
From Statement I
Number of Students in class = 21 or 22 or 23 or 24 or
25 or 26
From Statement II
Number of Students in class = 25 or 26 or 27 or 28 or
29 or 30
Since, number of students can be divided into groups
of 5 students, therefore number of students must be
multiple of 5.
Number of students in the class = 25 or 30
On combining Statements I and II
Number of students in the class = 25
Hence, the data in both the Statement I and II
together are necessary to answer the question.
